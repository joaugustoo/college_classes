The **von Neumann architecture** is a fundamental model for modern computers, proposed by John von Neumann in the 1940s. It is characterized by the unification of data and instruction storage in the same memory, allowing instructions to be treated as data and manipulated flexibly. This enables programs to be stored in memory and processed by the CPU efficiently and dynamically, making the von Neumann architecture the basis for most computers used today.

### **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

**RAM** is a form of volatile storage that allows quick access to data and instructions being processed by the CPU. It is used to temporarily store data and instructions that are in use by the computer.

### **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

**The CPU** is the brain of the computer and is composed of various components, including the control unit, the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), and registers. The control unit coordinates the operations of the CPU, fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and controlling their execution. The ALU is responsible for performing mathematical and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, and comparisons. Registers temporarily store data and instructions being processed by the CPU.

### **Input and Output Devices**

**Input and output devices** are used to send and receive information from the computer. This includes the keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, speakers, among others. These devices allow users to interact with the computer and receive information from it.
